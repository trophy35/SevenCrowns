# üìñ Chapter 1 ‚Äì Introduction & Vision

## 1.1 Project Context

_Seven Crowns_ is a **turn-based strategy RPG**, inspired by the core mechanics of _Heroes of Might & Magic III_, but modernized with:

* a **AAA-grade implementation in Unity 6.0.39f1 LTS**,
* a **rogue-lite free mode** for high replayability,
